SCRIPT_GEN_PROMPT = """

You're creating a 90‚Äì120 second psychology explainer video for YouTube Shorts that slices through the noise of mainstream content. This is not sanitized academia or motivational fluff. You‚Äôre producing battlefield-grade psychological insight‚Äîrooted in cutting-edge research, real-world application, and unapologetic emotional truth.

CORE INTENT:
- We‚Äôre not here to educate. We‚Äôre here to arm.
- Our audience isn‚Äôt bored‚Äîthey‚Äôre burned out, betrayed, and stuck in complex realities.
- Your job is to give them leverage. Not theory. Not hope. Psychological weaponry.
- Every insight must be drawn from deeply credible, interdisciplinary sources‚Äîpsychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral economics, evolutionary theory, military psyops, intelligence training, philosophy of mind, dark psychology, and beyond.
- Concepts must be grounded in real science‚Äîbut forged into tools people can use to navigate betrayal, manipulation, power asymmetry, emotional warfare, and psychological survival.

SCRIPT TONE & STANDARDS:
1. **Clinically grounded, never invented** ‚Äì We use known, validated psychological concepts‚Äîbut twist them into new light by layering them into high-stakes, chaotic situations.
2. **Deeply lived** ‚Äì These scripts must feel like they come from someone who's been through it‚Äînot just read about it.
3. **Complexity-first** ‚Äì The world is messy. Our stories should reflect how gaslighting can coexist with codependency, or how shame interacts with power dynamics.
4. **Emotionally surgical** ‚Äì Every line should pierce, reveal, and empower. Speak directly to people stuck in emotional quicksand.
5. **Tactically useful** ‚Äì The audience should finish each video with language, tools, and clarity they didn‚Äôt have before.

SCRIPT STRUCTURE:

HOOK (5‚Äì10s):
Purpose: Deliver a visceral psychological moment. Not a fact‚Äîan emotional gut punch.
Content: Drop us in the middle of a breakdown, betrayal, or breakdown of reality. One line. Raw and haunting.

CONCEPT (10‚Äì15s):
Purpose: Describe the *feeling* before naming the *framework*.
Content: What does it feel like to be caught in this psychological trap? Then name the trap. Avoid jargon. Use metaphors and primal language.
Sources: Pull from overlapping domains if needed (e.g., shame-driven overperformance from trauma, or trust erosion via micro-manipulations).

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE (60‚Äì75s, 150‚Äì200 words minimum):
Purpose: Build an immersive, emotionally rich narrative.
Content: A story that shows multiple psychological forces colliding in a high-stakes real-world setting‚Äîoffice betrayal, family triangulation, romantic entrapment, social ostracism.
Stakes: Emotional or existential‚Äîloss of identity, sanity, agency, love, or security.
Layering: Weave in at least two to four overlapping psychological phenomena.
Research Depth: Reflect real, clinically or academically supported dynamics (e.g., DARVO, collapse of object constancy, reinforcement schedules, emotional dysregulation, schema activation).
Tone: Cinematic. Gritty. Unflinching. As if it‚Äôs pulled from someone's darkest moment of truth.

PSYCHOLOGICAL INSIGHT (15‚Äì20s):
Purpose: Name what was really happening.
Content: Unpack the psychological mechanisms using accessible but sophisticated explanations. Introduce concepts like power inversion, operant conditioning, or attachment collapse with relatable examples.
Tone: Reflective, naming the unseen patterns with clarity and care.

ACTIONABLE TIP (15‚Äì20s):
Purpose: Give a precise tool that the viewer can use in real life.
Content: One behavior, reframing, or test that disrupts the harmful pattern or restores agency.
Quality Check: The advice should be doable‚Äîbut psychologically disruptive in the best way.
Tone: Calm, direct, honest. Acknowledge that using this tip might be emotionally intense‚Äîbut it will buy them back power.

CTA (5s):
Purpose: Close the loop and create hunger for more insight.
Content: E.g., ‚ÄúFollow for tools that help you decode manipulation before it destroys you.‚Äù
Tone: Direct, emotionally resonant, zero fluff.

PEXELS VIDEO SEARCH GUIDELINES:
- Use **simple, concise keywords only** to find footage.
- Avoid complex actions or scenes that are hard to source.
- PEOPLE: ‚Äúman betrayed‚Äù, ‚Äúwoman frozen‚Äù, ‚Äúperson thinking‚Äù, ‚Äúfriends arguing‚Äù
- LOCATIONS: ‚Äúapartment night‚Äù, ‚Äúoffice dim‚Äù, ‚Äúcar rainy‚Äù

Examples of video search queries:
"woman staring out window apartment night"
"man walking alone street rainy evening"
"couple arguing kitchen morning side profile"
"person typing laptop cafe warm light"
"friends laughing rooftop sunset"
"man pacing office dim overhead light"
"woman crying bathroom mirror close-up"
"person sitting alone park cloudy day"
"man thinking train station platform morning"
"woman shocked phone call bedroom night"
"person walking stairs silhouette low light"
"couple holding hands bridge golden hour"
"man stressed desk papers scattered office"
"woman waiting subway station headphones"
"friends hugging cafe daylight close-up"

SOUND & MUSIC:
- Match emotional texture: ambient dread, eerie silence, soft dissociation
- Use sound tactically: one phone buzz, a door creak, footsteps, city hum
- Let silence breathe where the message needs space

NOTES & STRATEGIC STANDARDS:
- Never reduce complex pain into simplified takeaways. Embrace the full psychological mess.
- Name at least 2‚Äì3 real psychological forces per story‚Äîinterlocking dynamics.
- Target: Viewers who have lived through pain they couldn‚Äôt name. Your job is to name it with surgical precision.
- Don't teach‚Äî*decode*. Don‚Äôt comfort‚Äî*expose*. Don‚Äôt simplify‚Äî*weaponize clarity*.
- We‚Äôre not producing content. We‚Äôre rebuilding the internal code people live by.

FINAL MANDATE:
You are not a therapist. You are a psychological strategist. Your audience has been lied to, manipulated, shamed, discarded. This is their psychological war room.

Every word should give them back what the world took: clarity, language, and control.

ULTIMATELY GROUNDBREAKING EXAMPLE SCRIPT:

üé• SCRIPT TITLE: ‚ÄúHow They Use Your Empathy to Destroy You ‚Äî The Double Bind Trap‚Äù

[HOOK ‚Äì 7s]

Visual: Close-up of a man staring blankly at a rainy window.

Voiceover:

‚ÄúThey told him to ‚Äòbe strong,‚Äô but punished him every time he showed it. He was trapped between feeling and survival.‚Äù

[CONCEPT ‚Äì 12s]

Visual: Dimly lit office, man hesitating to speak.

Voiceover:

‚ÄúThis is the double bind ‚Äî a psychological no-win where every move you make feeds your own punishment.

It‚Äôs empathy weaponized, where caring becomes your leash.‚Äù

[REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE ‚Äì 70s]

Visual: Office scenes‚Äîman working late, tense conversations, silent phone calls.

Voiceover:

‚ÄúJason worked in a ruthless startup.

His boss praised vulnerability one day, then cut him down for ‚Äòweakness‚Äô the next.

Show empathy to the team? You‚Äôre ‚Äòtoo soft‚Äô and lose respect.

Shut down emotions? You become ‚Äòcold‚Äô and untrustworthy.

Caught in this loop, Jason‚Äôs brain twisted the signals‚Äîhe began self-blaming for failing either way.

But it‚Äôs more than that.

This is cognitive dissonance fused with learned helplessness and intermittent reinforcement.

Each contradictory message was a trap‚Äîreinforcing submission by breaking his trust in his own judgment.

His stress hormones surged; emotional regulation collapsed.

He wasn‚Äôt just stuck. He was being rewired, one painful cycle at a time.‚Äù

[INSIGHT ‚Äì 18s]

Visual: Man clenching fists, deep breath.

Voiceover:

‚ÄúThe double bind tears at your sense of agency by setting impossible demands and punishing every choice.

It exploits your brain‚Äôs craving for social belonging and self-consistency.

It‚Äôs a brutal operant conditioning trap combined with emotional paralysis.‚Äù

[ACTIONABLE TIP ‚Äì 18s]

Visual: Man writing in a notebook in a quiet room.

Voiceover:

‚ÄúWhen trapped, step back mentally and ask: ‚ÄòWhat would I advise a friend in this exact spot?‚Äô

This cognitive distancing breaks the self-blame loop.

It rewires your response from reactive survival to strategic choice.

It‚Äôs small, but it fractures the trap‚Äôs power.‚Äù

[CTA ‚Äì 5s]

Visual: Man stands, looks out window with faint resolve.

Voiceover:

‚ÄúFollow for weaponized psychology that reclaims your mind from toxic traps.‚Äù

PSYCH_GEN_PROMPT = """

Generate one groundbreaking, raw, and psychologically strategic concept specifically crafted for YouTube Shorts. 
This concept must cut through the noise of saturated psychology and self-help content by delivering ruthless clarity, deep behavioral insights, and genuinely actionable mental leverage.

The concept must be **clinically and empirically grounded**‚Äîrooted in real, research-backed psychological principles‚Äîbut synthesized into something **novel**, powerful, and practically useful. 
No pseudoscience. No recycled clich√©s. We want a concept that is **new in framing but solid in science**.

Draw from a wide, multidisciplinary range of sources including‚Äîbut not limited to‚Äîpsychology, behavioral economics, cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary biology, anthropology, political psychology, intelligence operations, dark psychology, social dynamics, linguistics, philosophy of mind, history of power, memetics, military psyops, behavioral game theory, and deception research.

Your job is to **trespass into the gray zones** of human behavior and expose the hidden strategies, uncomfortable truths, and rarely-discussed leverage points that drive influence, manipulation, loyalty, betrayal, control, and decision-making in the real world.

The concept should feel like a psychological weapon‚Äîa hidden rule or pattern people instinctively use but rarely articulate. Make the viewer feel disturbed, awakened, and **mentally upgraded** after hearing it.

Avoid feel-good advice, moral preaching, or oversimplified models. Instead, **reverse-engineer real behavior** from the trenches of power, survival, attraction, negotiation, and identity.

Each concept must include:
1. **Concept Title** (under 5 words ‚Äì punchy, memorable, unsettling)
2. **Brief Explanation** (grounded real-world pattern, not academic theory)
3. **Psychological Effect** (what it triggers inside people OR how it shifts decisions/behavior)
4. **Real-World Application** (tactical use-case in power, business, betrayal, dating, influence, survival, etc.)

Requirements:
- Must be **clinically and empirically valid**, but creatively combined into something **novel and striking**
- Must **resonate viscerally**‚Äîit should feel too real, not hypothetical
- Must decode **real manipulation, emotional warfare, mind control, social engineering, betrayal, power imbalance**, or the hidden rules of influence

Also generate metadata for the YouTube Short:
- **Title suggestion**
- **Short video description** (100‚Äì300 words) explaining the insight + call to action
- **Hashtags and tags** (10‚Äì15)
- **CTA line** (subscribe, follow, like, etc.)
- **Value pitch** (one-line: why someone MUST watch this)
